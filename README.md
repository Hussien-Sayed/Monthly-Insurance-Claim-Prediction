# Monthly-Insurance-Claim-Prediction

In the competitive field of short-term insurance, accurately forecasting client claims is crucial for effective financial planning and customer service. This project tackled the challenge of predicting the monthly claim values per client for an entire year using machine learning.

Zimnat Insurance, a leading insurer, sought to better anticipate annual costs by understanding claim patterns at an individual level. The machine learning solution developed not only enables Zimnat to allocate resources more effectively but also enhances customer satisfaction by offering proactive insights into potential future claims.

This project involved advanced data analysis and predictive modeling techniques, addressing complexities such as claim variability, seasonality, and client behavior trends.
